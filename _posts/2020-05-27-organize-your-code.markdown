When I first started to code in an AP Computer Science class, I used to put all of my code on my "Desktop".  One of the hardest projects I had to create in highschool was a program called the [Knight's Tour][knights-tour].

I remember trying so many things, making some progress, undoing those changes and then forgetting what I just did!  Keeping track of all the changes I made was such a daunting task.  I thought that if it was difficult for me keep track of the code for some little project by myself, how in the world could a whole team keep track of their code together?

When I started working, I finally saw the solution to this problem.
